# PMT

PMT (**P**attern **M**atching **T**ool) is a tool for exact and approximate pattern matching.

## Exact Matching Algorithms
- Brute Force (Naive)
- KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)
- Aho-Corasick
- Boyer-Moore
- ShiftOr (Bitap)

## Approximate Matching Algorithms
- Sellers
- Ukkonen

## How to use
Run `make` to compile.

Run `./bin/pmt --help` for supported options.

## Results
`doc/report.pdf` (in portuguese) contains details and limitations of the implementation, as well as comparisons between the algorithms and the _grep_ tool.
